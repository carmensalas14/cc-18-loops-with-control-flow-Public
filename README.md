# Code Challenge: Loops with Control Flow

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function `absoluteValue` that **returns** the absolute value of a number. If the value is not a number, it returns `null`. Complete this function **without** using Math.abs() .
```

```

3. Write a function named `oddAndEvenInFifteen` that will console.log if a number is a mut between 0 and 15. 
```
oddAndEvenInFifteen()
// first five console.logs:
// "0 is even"
// "1 is odd"
// "2 is even"
// "3 is odd"
// "4 is even"
// "5 is odd"
```

### Bonus 
3. Write a function `multiplesOfFourAndFive` that **returns an array** of all positive numbers from 1 to 100 if that number is a multiple of 4 and a mutliple of 5. 
```
multiplesOfFourAndSix() // returns [20,40,50,60]
```

4. Write a fucntion named `countMultiplesOfTwoAndThree` that takes in an array of integers and returns the number of integers in the array that are multiples of two and three. 
```
countMultiplesOfTwoAndThree([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) // returns 3
countMultiplesOfTwoAndThree([15,23,35,45,67]) // returns 4
countMultiplesOfTwoAndThree([2,6,14]) // returns 2
```
